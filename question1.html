<!-- Q.1 What’s Box Model in CSS ? 
The box model is a fundamental concept in CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) that describes how elements in a webpage are rendered and displayed. It defines the properties and behavior of the rectangular box that surrounds every HTML element.
In the box model, an element is represented as a box that consists of four main components:
Content: This is the actual content of the element, such as text, images, or other HTML elements. The content area is defined by the width and height properties.
Padding: The padding is the space between the content and the border of the element. It can be set using the padding property and affects the size of the box.
Border: The border is a line that surrounds the padding and content area. It can be customized with properties like border-width, border-style, and border-color.
Margin: The margin is the space outside the border, which separates one element from another. It can be set using the margin property and affects the positioning and layout of elements on the page.
The box model allows you to control the dimensions and spacing of elements on a webpage. By manipulating the width, height, padding, border, and margin properties, you can achieve precise control over the layout and appearance of elements.
