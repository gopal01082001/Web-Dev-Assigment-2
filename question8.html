<!-- Q.8 Difference between absolute and relative and sticky and fixed position explain with example.
Here's an explanation of the differences between absolute, relative, sticky, and fixed positions in CSS, along with examples:
Absolute Position:
Elements with position: absolute are positioned relative to their closest positioned ancestor (an ancestor with a position value of relative, absolute, or fixed), or the initial containing block if there is no positioned ancestor.
An absolutely positioned element is taken out of the normal document flow, so it doesn't affect the positioning of other elements.
It can be moved anywhere on the page using the top, right, bottom, and left properties.
Example:
css
.container {
  position: relative;
}
.absolute-element {
  position: absolute;
  top: 50px;
  left: 20px;
}
Relative Position:
Elements with position: relative are positioned relative to their normal position in the document flow.
It allows the use of positioning properties like top, right, bottom, and left to move the element from its normal position.
Other elements in the document flow are not affected by the relative positioning of the element.
Example:
css
Copy code
.relative-element {
  position: relative;
  top: 20px;
  left: 30px;
}
Sticky Position:
Elements with position: sticky are positioned based on the user's scroll position.
A sticky element is initially positioned according to the normal document flow, but then becomes fixed (like position: fixed) when the user scrolls to a specific threshold or "sticky" position.
It behaves as position: relative until the scroll position reaches the defined threshold, and then switches to position: fixed.
Example:
css
.sticky-element {
  position: sticky;
  top: 100px;
}
Fixed Position:
Elements with position: fixed are positioned relative to the viewport (the browser window) and do not move when the page is scrolled.
It is commonly used for elements that need to remain in a fixed position on the screen, such as navigation menus or banners.
Fixed elements are removed from the normal document flow and do not affect the positioning of other elements.
Example:
.fixed-element {
  position: fixed;
  top: 20px;
  right: 30px;
}
Understanding the differences between these positioning properties allows you to control the layout and positioning of elements on your webpage according to your specific requirements.
