<!-- Q.3 What is VW/VH ?
VW (Viewport Width) and VH (Viewport Height) are units of measurement in CSS that allow you to size elements relative to the viewport dimensions.
VW (Viewport Width): 1 VW is equal to 1% of the width of the viewport. It represents a relative measurement based on the width of the browser window. For example, if the width of the viewport is 1000 pixels, 1 VW would be equal to 10 pixels (1% of 1000).
Usage example:
css
p {
  font-size: 3vw;
}
This sets the font size of the <p> elements to be 3% of the viewport width.
VH (Viewport Height): 1 VH is equal to 1% of the height of the viewport. It represents a relative measurement based on the height of the browser window. For example, if the height of the viewport is 800 pixels, 1 VH would be equal to 8 pixels (1% of 800).
Usage example:
css
section {
  height: 50vh;
}
This sets the height of the <section> element to be 50% of the viewport height.
VW and VH units are useful when you want to create responsive designs that adapt to different screen sizes and aspect ratios. By using these units, you can ensure that elements scale proportionally based on the viewport dimensions, allowing for consistent and flexible layouts. They are particularly helpful in creating fluid and responsive typography, as well as for sizing containers and images dynamically.
