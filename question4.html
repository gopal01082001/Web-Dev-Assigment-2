<!-- Q.4 Whats difference between Inline, Inline Block and block ?
The differences between inline, inline-block, and block are related to how elements are displayed and how they interact with other elements in the layout. Here's an overview of each display type:
Inline:
Inline elements do not start on a new line; they flow along with the surrounding content.
They only take up the necessary width and height to accommodate their content.
Margins and paddings on inline elements only affect the space within the element, not the layout of surrounding elements.
Examples of inline elements are <span>, <a>, <em>, and <strong>.
Inline Block:
Inline-block elements behave like inline elements but can have a specified width, height, margins, and paddings.
They flow along with the surrounding content and do not start on a new line.
Inline-block elements respect the box model properties, allowing you to control their dimensions and spacing.
Examples of inline-block elements are <img>, <button>, and <input>.
Block:
Block-level elements start on a new line and take up the full width available within their containing element.
They stack vertically, creating a line break before and after the element.
Block-level elements can have specified width, height, margins, and paddings.
Margins and paddings on block elements affect the layout of surrounding elements by creating space.
Examples of block-level elements are <div>, <p>, <h1> to <h6>, <ul>, and <li>.
In summary, the key differences between these display types are related to their flow behavior, dimensions, and interaction with surrounding elements. Inline elements flow with the text, taking up only the necessary space. Inline-block elements behave like inline elements but can have defined dimensions. Block-level elements start on a new line, take up the full width available, and can have specified dimensions that affect the layout of surrounding elements.
